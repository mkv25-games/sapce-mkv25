# Space - mkv25

An experiment in creating a cross-platform application using [Electron JS](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start).

## Quick Start

Run:
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

This should open up an electron window, with the template, list of dependencies and versions, and the current time incrementing every second.

## TODO

- Build a persistent storage model
- Tidy up the UI and CSS
- Introduce Font Awesome
- Replace default image assets
- Add Start, Game, and End screens
- Save, and Load screens

## Done

- Set up basic Electron wrapper
- Set up basic Vue application with Routing
- Build a full page interactive application
- Configure Electron to work with the file based version of the compiled Vue application
